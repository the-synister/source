Synister is a substractive software synthesizer made by students of the TU Berlin. Downloads include a standalone version (PC/Mac) and VST2 Plugins (Windows 32/64bit) (OSX 64bit) for use in Digital Audio Workstations (DAWs). Synister has been tested on the following DAWs: Logic, Ableton Live, Cubase and Maschine and on Windows 7, 8, 10 and OSX El Captain.

### Features

Synister has 3 oscillators, 3 envelopes, 3 LFO's, 2 filters (which can be ladder, bandpass, highpass, or lowpass), 4 effects (delay, chorus, clipping, and low fidelity), and last but not least, a step sequencer with up to 8 steps!

The modulation has been made as easy as possible. Select the source, regulate the amount - done!

The oscillators and the filters element's can be modulated by different MiDi's CC and/or an LFO or Envelopes! 

For the LFO's and Envelopes, the modulation can be only made by the MIDI's CC!
